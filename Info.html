<p>This creature is unlike other species on Gymir, in the fact that it gives semi-live birth. It grows its spawn from the thoracic. One thorax can contain up to 3 children. The Cenode grows thoraces throughout its lifespan and usually peaks at around 13, though on rare occasions up to 25 have been seen. This is most likely due to infertility in the specimen. When a child is larger than the thorax that contains it, the thorax containing it will stretch rapidly until it eventually combusts and lets the child out. This has the downside of putting high pressure on nearby amnions and potentially making them burst while its spawns are still fetal. After giving birth, the amniotic fluid that was once inside of the thorax will provide adhesion to both sections of the mother Cenode. This can take from 1 day to an entire week. Though this report has been referring to Cenodes as females, they are in fact, asexual and use a form of fragmentation to reproduc</p></a>
