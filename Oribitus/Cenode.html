    <h>Biology</h>
    <p>This creature is unlike other species on Gymir, in the fact that it gives semi-live birth. It grows its spawn from the thoracic. One thorax can contain up to 3 children. The Cenode grows thoraces throughout its lifespan and usually peaks at around 13, though on rare occasions up to 25 have been seen. This is most likely due to infertility in the specimen. When a child is larger than the thorax that contains it, the thorax containing it will stretch rapidly until it eventually combusts and lets the child out.</p>
    <h>Safety</h>
    <p>Cenodes are generally slower than the average male in their assigned AM Suit, though they are very good at turning corners and can catch up easily if you decelerate at any point. Do not, under any circumstances, approach a Cenode when it is in postpartum as it will put you and the Cenode in great danger.</p>
