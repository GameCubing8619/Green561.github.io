    <h>History</h>
    <p>Phlogiston was one of the last planets in the Oribitus system to be discovered. Located in 298 by astronomer Isaac Miller. Due to its high temperatures and lack of natural resources, it was not a point of interest for researchers. However, in the early 500s, several reactors were set up near the planet's surface, making it a semi-factory moon.</p>
