<h>Biology</h>
<p>This species of Reaper originated from near the coast of the Gymirean mainland, though it has migrated to the Lazaran trench and is now considered an invasive species. Due to the depth and pressure of the trench, the Multesca has gained several deformities, as its body is not used to the environment.  The main difference between the common Lazaran reaper and the Multesca is its behavior. Rather than being territorial predators like Lazaran reapers, it prefers to hunt alone and stalk its prey. The Multesca also has very different biology. Instead of several mandibles meant for tearing flesh, it has 4 that contain a paralyzing neurotoxin, meant to trap prey after it has snuck up on them, instead of large, yet microscopically razored claws, it has rather weak claws that are mostly used for simply moving objects. Similarly to most apex predators, the Multesca has eyes in front of its head, rather than the sides.</p></a>
