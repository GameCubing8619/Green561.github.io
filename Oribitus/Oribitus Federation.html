<h>History</h>
<p>The Federation originated on planet Vulcan and started as a small army near the north, where it is coldest. Eventually, they conquered more land and expanded to other celestial bodies around 752 P.V.C. Due to their large numbers and dangerous weapons, they were able to conquer other celestial bodies such as Oran and Limos (752 and 760). The federation’s origin planet, Vulcan became what is commonly known as a “factory moon” despite it being a planet. These types of celestial bodies are usually constructed over several centuries to produce different types of equipment. Though, Vulcan was mechanized in only 30 years. It mainly produces weapons and spacecraft. One of the federation's main bases of operation is Carrier-A—a massive spacecraft located in a classified area of the Cyran Nebula. A Carrier-B was under construction but a terrorist attack forced the construction of it to a halt.</p></a>
<h>Mechanica Research Division</h>
<p>The M.R.D. is a division of the Oribitus Federation dedicated to researching mechanical anomalies. For example, the mission on Limos to destroy the unknown mechanism that was simply known as “The Drill”. As of 1271 P.V.C. 6 out of the 7 known anomalies in the Oribitus system have been neutralized. Except for the machine in the Lazaran trench on Gymir. An operation was attempted with both androids and humans but was unsuccessful.</p>
