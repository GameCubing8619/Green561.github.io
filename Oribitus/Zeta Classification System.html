<h>History</h>
<p>The Federation originated on planet Vulcan and started as a small army near the north, where it is coldest. Eventually, they conquered more land and expanded to other celestial bodies around 752 P.V.C. Due to their large numbers and dangerous weapons, they were able to conquer other celestial bodies such as Oran and Limos (752 and 760). The federation’s origin planet, Vulcan became what is commonly known as a “factory moon” despite it being a planet. These types of celestial bodies are usually constructed over several centuries to produce different types of equipment. Though, Vulcan was mechanized in only 30 years. It mainly produces weapons and spacecraft. One of the federation's main bases of operation is Carrier-A—a massive spacecraft located in a classified area of the Cyran Nebula. A Carrier-B was under construction but a terrorist attack forced the construction of it to a halt.</p></a>
<h>Function</h>
<p>α - No-hazard celestial body. Human life is perfectly sustainable. Humans are always at the top of the food chain.</p>
<p>β - Very Low-hazard celestial body. Human life is decently sustainable. Humans are almost always at the top of the food chain.</p>
<p>γ - Low-hazard celestial body. Human life may need some adaptations to be sustainable. Humans have a chance to not be at the top of the food chain.</p>
<p>δ - Mesial-hazard celestial body. Human life is not very sustainable. Humans are rarely at the top of the food chain.</p>
<p>ϵ - High-hazard celestial body. Human life is rarely sustainable. Humans are almost never at the top of the food chain.</p>
<p>ζ - Very High-hazard celestial body. Human life is virtually impossible. Humans are at the bottom of the food chain.</p>
